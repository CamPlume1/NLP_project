networking is always one of the more complicated issues,Antero
not usually fun kind of challange,Antero
so people don't usually answer those unless they already know the answer,Antero
I feel like a gif recording of you running it might give people a better sense,Lica
Ok,Tiegan
One sec,Tiegan
#webdevelopment might be better than the general channel,Antero
Aight thanks man,Tiegan
Hello,Omid
👋,Omid
hello,Antero
cleanest code you'll ever see,Dallie
```python#timer created by LoHud/Minerimport time #imports time for time.sleep()while True: #the loop for the timer prompt = input('Specify a timer length in seconds: ) #taking input from the user if int(prompt) > 60: #checking if timer is less than 60 seconds. print('Timer must be 60 seconds or less.') elif int(prompt) < 1: #checking if timer is higher than 0 seconds. print('Timer must be higher than 0.') else: #if the timer is successful print(f'Timer has been set to {prompt} seconds.

I am 3 days into learning python and im loving it! I hope to progress from here. This is just so I can look back on :).'''```,Falah
Timer command I created (works 100%). How can I make it so the user can say 5minutes or 10seconds?,Falah
As of now it works in seconds.,Falah
tell them to enter in seconds?,Antero
its gonna come down to a design decision I think,Antero
Parse the input string,Jaled
5 mim or 10 sec,Jaled
"maybe you can accept things like `[""10h 2s""]`",Antero
I don't understand how though,Falah
just split and convert to all seconds,Antero
I want to make it like that yes,Falah
but I do not get how to detect the h as a hour or m as a minute,Falah
You split the string take one half as the value and check other in your if statement,Jaled
`'h in some_str`,Antero
run the split list through a for loop,Antero
"```pythonif timescale == \'min\': time_value = 60elif timescale == \'sec\': passelse: raise ValueError(""Must be a valid time unit"")```",Jaled
why =?,Falah
so let me make ex test rn,Falah
also it's `==` @Oouja,Antero
Because you have a second value but if you need minutes you mutliply it by 60,Jaled
Yes thanks i never proofread the preudocode i write in discord,Jaled
```pythoneh = input('Enter a timer length'):if eh.find() = m time_value = 60```?,Falah
I've been looking for a good definition of an Element... Can't really find one... What exactly are elements?,Edvinas
How do you do random again,Falah
"```pythonmachine = randomchoice('high','low')```",Falah
forgot lol,Falah
random.choice,Antero
not working,Falah
wrap the choices in a list,Antero
wdum,Falah
they are in one,Falah
"```pythonimport time; import randomguess = input('Guess if the number is high or low: )machine = random.choice('high','low')if guess == machine: print(f'Correct! Number was {machine}!')elif guess != machine: print(f'Incorrect! Number was {machine}!')```",Falah
still not working,Falah
```pyimport randomrandom.choice(['a b'])Out[3]: a'```,Antero
#helpchestnut lets move out of the general,Antero
k,Falah
Can you run a `.py` file directlt from terminal?,Witten
yep?,Sandu
```shpython path/to/file.py```,Sandu
ok,Witten
It says `Python: command not found`,Witten
I'm using a chromebook and VSC if that makes a difference,Witten
Also another thing after I do a math calculation. It has like 13 decimal places. Is there a way to make it like only 3?,Witten
hello thanks for having me ^^,Khlifa
What?,Witten
ah i just joined,Khlifa
Oh,Witten
for ml what's like the actual difference between TF and PyTorch? aren't they basically the same thing?,Tamya
long story short you can kinda do the same things but the way you express ideas is different,Irlanda
anyone know how to use pythondebugger package in Atom IDE to run on a python package instead of one python script?,Maleeyah
@Zumux yes you van,Ander
can,Ander
"From the programming challenges image in the pinned posts \\#2 is Make an elastic producer/consumer task queue"". Can anyone explain what an elastic task queue is?",Daelan
"f""{integer}:.4f",Ander
Try doing that,Ander
Integer is justa placeholder,Ander
For number,Ander
whoops,Ander
4 decimal places is actually,Ander
"f""{integer:.4f}",Ander
"```pythonimport timerock = input(\'Enter a number (1m) (5m): \')if rock[1] == m"": timer = rock[:1]  60 print(timer)else: print(\'not m!\')```",Falah
I need it to understand that m == minute and if 1m is provided it will set timer variable to 60 seconds,Falah
Stop spamming your question,Ander
I edited it,Falah
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pythondatetimetimedeltafunction/,Ander
Try this,Ander
and using datetime.datetime objects,Ander
Doesn't help if im still not understanding it,Falah
@El Brian Perhaps read the explanation cup linked,Eduard
That is completely different,Falah
im reading it rn,Falah
Do you know how to read documentation?,Eduard
Google ``datetime documentation``,Eduard
I do not need datetime,Falah
And search for datetime.timedelta(),Eduard
But I do not need datetime,Falah
Ok then tell me this then,Falah
```pythonrock = 5print(rock[:1:])```,Falah
why does this print out 55555555555,Falah
Read the last element going by ones,Eduard
Do you know how lists work?,Ander
start:stop:step,Falah
How do I get everything but the last one character in string,Falah

Sure one second,Eduard
whoops,Ander
> why does this print out 55555555555that should not print out `55555555555`,Emperor
I think i linked the wrong link,Ander
Just tell me how do I print out everything besides the last character?,Falah
lets say someone inputs 55m,Falah
something[:1],Emperor
I did that but it still outputs 55555555555555555555555555,Falah
what's your code?,Emperor
You have me blocked @Professor,Eduard
"```pythonimport timerock = input(\'Enter a number (1m) (5m): \')if rock[1] == m"": timer = rock[:1]  60 print(timer)else: print(\'not m!\')```",Falah

No,Eduard
or it won't let me msg u lol,Zayna
it's a discord setting,Zayna
you multiply the string by 60 `rock[:1]  60`,Emperor
You can change your settings if you want me to link you the server otherwise find your own,Eduard
k,Zayna
there,Zayna
I need to convert minutes to seconds,Falah
"```pyimport sched times = sched.scheduler(time.time time.sleep)def do_something(sc):  print Doing stuff..."" # do your stuff s.enter(60 1 do_something (sc,))s.enter(60 1 do_something (s,))s.run()```",Eduard
Here,Eduard
I thought 5  60 is 300..,Falah
First one from stack overflow,Eduard
try now theroumag,Zayna
`'5'` is currently a string,Emperor
"!e```pyprint(""5  6)```",Yancarlos
so convert to int?,Falah
@salt :white_check_mark: Your eval job has completed with return code 0.```py555555```,Yusra
exactly,Emperor
!e print(5  6),Falah
Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.,Yusra
ok,Falah
that's only helpers+,Emperor
multiplying a string repeats it,Yancarlos
"!e```pyprint(""test"")```",Eduard
Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.,Yusra
Ah only in bot commands I see,Eduard
Lets unionize,Ander
ok I did it,Falah
"```pythonimport timerock = input(\'Enter a number (1m) (5m): \')if rock[1] == m"": timer = int(rock[:1])  60 time.sleep(timer) print(""done!"")else: print(\'not m!\')```",Falah
We need asyncio on !eval,Ander
is this a bad way of doing it?,Falah
That sounds like a hayday for exploits,Eduard
If a code takes too long it won't eval it,Eduard
6 seconds is the limit,Emperor
Why is it limit?,Falah
Why not push to at least 30 seconds,Falah
Threading/multiprocessing would cause problems,Eduard
that's disabled,Emperor
Because the server is not for running your code,Eduard
Why pay for a domain just borrow the servers,Eduard
it is very rare to need anything longer than 23 seconds for an example,Emperor
"Just do eval(f""{rock[:1]}60)",Ander
Furthermore you can only do so much in 6 seconds,Eduard
System scans and more malicious things have a time cap,Eduard
we encourage you guys to try and break snekbox,Emperor
I will,Ander
Importing several modules would probably be all you could do,Eduard
Where was the bot's source?,Ander
And too short to install anything,Eduard
It's on the Git I believe,Eduard
https://www.github.com/pythondiscord/snekbox is what you want,Emperor
I will now call github,Ander
that's where the code is actually executed,Emperor
The Git,Ander
From now on,Ander
"```pythonimport timerock = input(\'Enter a number (1m) (5m): \')if rock[1] == m"": timer = int(rock[:1])  60 print(f\'Your timer was set for {timer} minutes!

good job! now try and support multiple units like `5m 30s`,Emperor
Here datetime is useful,Eduard
snekbox looks interesting,Daelan
ok,Falah
yes datetime would be useful but he's trying to manually parse it,Emperor
can you use it with AWS lambda?,Daelan
You could use regexs for this,Eduard
Would be a nice intro,Eduard
I want to manually do it,Falah
for education purposes 🙂,Falah
the previous code jam's qualifier was to parse an iso8601 timestamp,Emperor
https://github.com/pythondiscord/codejam6qualifier,Emperor
Could you give n example of one?,Eduard
that seems quite a different task. That timestamp is a fixed format,Ovidi
it can be quite dynamic,Emperor
The task seems simple enough,Eduard
it has different parts but it is neither unlimited nor ambiguous,Ovidi
i agree with that,Emperor
there was a regex one liner lying around for this qualifier somewhere,Emperor
I've been meaning to rewrite my solution,Yancarlos
yeah mine wasn't the prettiest but i haven't gotten around to refactoring it,Emperor
When is the next CodeFest and are all of them this easy @dennis ?,Eduard
the next code jam is scheduled for sometime in july i believe. here are the previous ones: https://pythondiscord.com/pages/codejams/,Emperor
i think this was it https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267659945086812160/665412209614258176,Emperor

yeah same xhibit,Emperor
spent earlier on graph drawing will work more tomorrow,Yancarlos
↑ pls,Falah
oh yeah i saw that earlier. it looks very cool,Emperor
so say the user enters `5m 30s` @El Brian how would you split that up,Emperor
uses graph_tool for the layout algorithm (written in c++) so it should be reasonably fast,Yancarlos
rock.split,Falah
@dennis can we go #helpfalafel ?,Falah
that would be a good idea,Emperor
ok,Falah
how does graph_tool implement into kivy?,Emperor
if i import math wouldn't pi be defined?,Joellen
oh it's math.pi,Joellen
why is this discord so full but dead,Joellen
well it doesn't I'm calling graph_tool's layout algorithm and then iterating over the positions of the nodes in kivy to update the canvas,Yancarlos
ohh that makes much more sense,Emperor
layout algorithm is O(n log n) so it's nice that graph_tool is written in c++,Yancarlos
that is very fast especially in c++,Emperor
good choice. i've never heard of graphtool,Emperor
well it's not so fast for thousands of nodes,Yancarlos
which I'll work up to tomorrow I work on nodes interacting with touch_events,Yancarlos
so I can drag individual nodes,Yancarlos
i'm excited to see where your project goes. it looks pretty impressive already,Emperor
I have a few plans but the idea was so I could watch dynamic networks in realtime,Yancarlos
looking forward to see it in #memes,Emperor
hopefully i'll get there,Yancarlos
is there a way to walk my function through each step to see what its doing?,Ayviana
like im getting an output but not the one im expecting and im trying to see what it sees,Ayviana
the debugger,Emperor
do i just put the red dot on the line i want to start at and hit step?,Ayviana
im in spyder,Ayviana
you put the red dot where you want to start debugging and then run your debugger,Emperor
then you can step through the code using the options that spyder provides,Emperor
(i've never used that ide),Emperor
seems like its calling the funcion one step but im not sure,Ayviana
you should be able to see the value of every variable while stepping through,Emperor

GOt a question regarding a personal project. I\'ve been researching on ways to make a sneakerbot for nike and stuff particularly for new shoes that haven\'t yet released but the problem is that even using stuff like selenium is difficult because shoes that haven\'t dropped yet obviously don\'t have add to cart so I was wondering from that perspective how would one go about designing a bot for trying to buy a shoe at a particular date when there\'s no way you can even add it to your cart,Makar

so many channels here guess I overlooked that one,Suiping
what's the difference between the old style of formatting such as %5.2f and the new style {:5.2f},Joellen
if I'm understanding the question correctly...,Suiping
the .format makes you list the variables at the end,Suiping
(higher room for error imo),Suiping
and the f'{} allows you to type individual variables as you need them so you don't have to list them in order after you typed out the string,Suiping
(less chance of error),Suiping
both do the job just fine though,Suiping
it is a matter of preference,Suiping

Hey guys! I started learning python a few days ago and I just completed the python crash course from freecodecamp.org. What should i learn next? I mean how do i proceed now?,Khlifa
@killcams That sort of problem is almost always caused by installing the requirements to a different instance of Python than the one you're invoking to run the script,Ramon
oh,Melodi
would it be because I have 2 different pythons installed,Melodi
@Deleted User Look for some problems in your life that seem like they are interesting applications of Python as problem solving or automation tool,Ramon
@killcams Almost certainly yes,Ramon
okay so i have 3.8.2 and 3.5.0,Melodi
which one do i uninstall,Melodi
If one of them is tied to something important then it's unwise to just remove them,Ramon
Which OS are you on?,Ramon
uhh wdym by OS,Melodi
sorry im stupid,Melodi
operating sysem,Ramon
Windows Linux Mac OS etc.,Ramon
ph,Melodi
oh,Melodi
windows,Melodi
OK,Ramon
If you type `py` at the command line that will typically bring up the most recent version of Python,Ramon
using cmd right,Melodi
so you can use that to disambiguate which version you want to install in or use,Ramon
Yes,Ramon
3.8.2,Melodi
eg. `py 3.8 m pip list` will bring up Python 3.8 and run `pip`,Ramon
`py 3.8 myscript.py` will launch `myscript.py` using 3.8,Ramon
How would you get people to use your creations? I feel like I'm programming for no reason since its not being used.,Claudette
@TricolorHen061 Post your work on GitHub or some other codesharing service. Get into a Discord or Reddit community that revolves around the thing you're trying to address,Ramon
wait i think im using 3.5.0,Melodi
None,Melodi
that shows up,Melodi
@killcams either way you can use `py` to bring up and work with a specific version,Ramon
Use `py 0` to see which versions are installed,Ramon
3.832,Melodi
and,Melodi
3.532,Melodi
@Infinimata that sounds difficult? i will try,Khlifa
@Deleted User Python's a tool it's used to make things easier. Look for something in your own life that's worth making easier or working on,Ramon
Abstract problems aren't as compelling,Ramon
should i uninstall both pythons and just reset everything,Melodi
@killcams As long as you are fairly confident you don't have anything that depends on one that'll be trashed,Ramon
alright,Melodi
okay,Khlifa
Also you have the 32bit versions installed; you might want to install the 64bit versions,Ramon
unless you're trying to keep compatibility with some 32bit library but that's exceedingly rare at this point,Ramon
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python350/,Melodi
which one,Melodi
Windows x8664 executable installer,Ramon
that's generally the best bet,Ramon
@Deleted User In my case I was having organizational problems with my creative projects so I've been making a personal wiki app,Ramon
that's cool,Khlifa
Yeah I posted about it ealier in #memes,Ramon
I only just today made the first public release  it's still very alpha quality,Ramon
oh i will check that out,Khlifa
wait wtf,Melodi
that legit fixed everything,Melodi

Learning any language makes learning any language more doable,Eduard
Except PHP screw PHP,Eduard
what about PHP?,Adrina
also learning python didn't seem to affect my learning html or css,Adrina
learn lisp or scheme,Haja
its beginning of everything,Haja
the,Haja
Html and CSS aren't programming languages @snowyeti,Eduard
is javascript a programming language?,Adrina
yes it is,Haja
everything which is turing complete is a programming language,Haja
turing complete?,Adrina
and what do you mean by lisp,Adrina
@xQSuV5Fs Html is not turning complete,Eduard
It needs Javascript,Eduard
turing complete is a theorethically comcept whcih means you can simulate a machine,Haja

html is just a declarative language,Haja
so apart from CSS HTML JS do i need to learn anything else?,Adrina
yes how browser are working,Haja

how come the curly brackets are weirdly placed,Adrina
the } is on its own line,Adrina
and { is oddly placed too,Adrina
That's just the way you do it generally. Do you understand what they're for?,Esme
statement?,Adrina
Same line { is heresy it deserves it's own line. Fite me.,Jaled
You use curly braces to separate out blocks of code. So almost everything ends up wrapped in them,Esme
But that's not python,Esme
why is { on the same line as the if (condition),Adrina
this is javascript,Adrina
That's the convention,Esme

Is there a reason why there is only python discussion and not unix discussion etc?,Eduard
Just because of this server's focus I assume?,Eduard

#unix exists,Yancarlos

yes this was mentioned earlier I wonder if it's worth making an announcement about,Yancarlos
or if that would be too advertisey,Yancarlos
that would be really usefull for anyone wanting to learn considering alot of people seem to not like reading books for some reason,Jofre
Al does this quite often.,Exequiel
we've announced a few of them in the past.,Exequiel

@dummy sorry for the ping can html parser can fetch docs of d.py or I need to use sphinx parser only?,Sayge
The parser wouldn't get anything,Eduard
You would hard code the path to the elements you want based off the parts of the website you want,Eduard
Beautiful Soup can do all the parsing you need,Eduard
I think I may have misunderstood the question @Anubhav,Eduard
Did my answer help?,Eduard
Ok I want something like this,Sayge
!doc user,Sayge
