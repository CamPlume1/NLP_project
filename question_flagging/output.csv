Timer command I created (works 100%). How can I make it so the user can say 5minutes or 10seconds?,Falah,1,1,17
As of now it works in seconds.,Falah,,,
tell them to enter in seconds?,Antero,1,0,
its gonna come down to a design decision I think,Antero,,,
Parse the input string,Jaled,,,
5 mim or 10 sec,Jaled,,,
"maybe you can accept things like `[""10h 2s""]`",Antero,,,
I don't understand how though,Falah,,,
just split and convert to all seconds,Antero,,,
I want to make it like that yes,Falah,,,
but I do not get how to detect the h as a hour or m as a minute,Falah,1,1,26
You split the string take one half as the value and check other in your if statement,Jaled,,,
`'h in some_str`,Antero,,,
run the split list through a for loop,Antero,,,
nada,Jaled,,,
why =?,Falah,1,0,
so let me make ex test rn,Falah,,,
also it's `==` @Oouja,Antero,,,
Because you have a second value but if you need minutes you mutliply it by 60,Jaled,,,
Yes thanks i never proofread the preudocode i write in discord,Jaled,,,

@El Brian Perhaps read the explanation cup linked,Eduard,,,
That is completely different,Falah,,,

Ah only in bot commands I see,Eduard,,,
Lets unionize,Ander,,,
ok I did it,Falah,,,

We need asyncio on !eval,Ander,,,
is this a bad way of doing it?,Falah,1,0,
That sounds like a hayday for exploits,Eduard,,,
If a code takes too long it won't eval it,Eduard,,,
6 seconds is the limit,Emperor,,,
Why is it limit?,Falah,1,0,
Why not push to at least 30 seconds,Falah,1,1,152
Threading/multiprocessing would cause problems,Eduard,,,
that's disabled,Emperor,,,
Because the server is not for running your code,Eduard,,,
Why pay for a domain just borrow the servers,Eduard,1,0,
it is very rare to need anything longer than 23 seconds for an example,Emperor,,,
"Just do eval(f""{rock[:1]}60)",Ander,,,
Furthermore you can only do so much in 6 seconds,Eduard,,,
System scans and more malicious things have a time cap,Eduard,,,

good job! now try and support multiple units like `5m 30s`,Emperor,,,
Here datetime is useful,Eduard,,,
snekbox looks interesting,Daelan,,,
ok,Falah,,,
yes datetime would be useful but he's trying to manually parse it,Emperor,,,
can you use it with AWS lambda?,Daelan,1,0,
You could use regexs for this,Eduard,,,
Would be a nice intro,Eduard,,,
I want to manually do it,Falah,,,
for education purposes 🙂,Falah,,,
the previous code jam's qualifier was to parse an iso8601 timestamp,Emperor,,,
https://github.com/pythondiscord/codejam6qualifier,Emperor,,,
Could you give n example of one?,Eduard,1,0,
that seems quite a different task. That timestamp is a fixed format,Ovidi,,,
it can be quite dynamic,Emperor,,,
The task seems simple enough,Eduard,,,
it has different parts but it is neither unlimited nor ambiguous,Ovidi,,,
i agree with that,Emperor,,,
there was a regex one liner lying around for this qualifier somewhere,Emperor,,,
I've been meaning to rewrite my solution,Yancarlos,,,
yeah mine wasn't the prettiest but i haven't gotten around to refactoring it,Emperor,,,

spent earlier on graph drawing will work more tomorrow,Yancarlos,,,
↑ pls,Falah,,,
oh yeah i saw that earlier. it looks very cool,Emperor,,,
so say the user enters `5m 30s` @El Brian how would you split that up,Emperor,1,0,
uses graph_tool for the layout algorithm (written in c++) so it should be reasonably fast,Yancarlos,,,
rock.split,Falah,,,
@dennis can we go #helpfalafel ?,Falah,1,0,
that would be a good idea,Emperor,,,
ok,Falah,,,
how does graph_tool implement into kivy?,Emperor,1,0,
if i import math wouldn't pi be defined?,Joellen,1,1,218
oh it's math.pi,Joellen,,,
why is this discord so full but dead,Joellen,1,0,
well it doesn't I'm calling graph_tool's layout algorithm and then iterating over the positions of the nodes in kivy to update the canvas,Yancarlos,,,
ohh that makes much more sense,Emperor,,,
layout algorithm is O(n log n) so it's nice that graph_tool is written in c++,Yancarlos,,,
that is very fast especially in c++,Emperor,,,
good choice. i've never heard of graphtool,Emperor,,,
well it's not so fast for thousands of nodes,Yancarlos,,,
which I'll work up to tomorrow I work on nodes interacting with touch_events,Yancarlos,,,
so I can drag individual nodes,Yancarlos,,,
i'm excited to see where your project goes. it looks pretty impressive already,Emperor,,,
I have a few plans but the idea was so I could watch dynamic networks in realtime,Yancarlos,,,
looking forward to see it in #memes,Emperor,,,
hopefully i'll get there,Yancarlos,,,
is there a way to walk my function through each step to see what its doing?,Ayviana,1,1,234
like im getting an output but not the one im expecting and im trying to see what it sees,Ayviana,,,
the debugger,Emperor,,,
do i just put the red dot on the line i want to start at and hit step?,Ayviana,1,1,237
im in spyder,Ayviana,,,
you put the red dot where you want to start debugging and then run your debugger,Emperor,,,
then you can step through the code using the options that spyder provides,Emperor,,,
(i've never used that ide),Emperor,,,
seems like its calling the funcion one step but im not sure,Ayviana,,,
you should be able to see the value of every variable while stepping through,Emperor,,,

what's the difference between the old style of formatting such as %5.2f and the new style {:5.2f},Joellen,1,1,265
if I'm understanding the question correctly...,Suiping,,,
the .format makes you list the variables at the end,Suiping,,,
(higher room for error imo),Suiping,,,
and the f'{} allows you to type individual variables as you need them so you don't have to list them in order after you typed out the string,Suiping,,,
(less chance of error),Suiping,,,
both do the job just fine though,Suiping,,,
it is a matter of preference,Suiping,,,

Hey guys! I started learning python a few days ago and I just completed the python crash course from freecodecamp.org. What should i learn next? I mean how do i proceed now?,Khlifa,1,0,
@killcams That sort of problem is almost always caused by installing the requirements to a different instance of Python than the one you're invoking to run the script,Ramon,,,
oh,Melodi,,,
would it be because I have 2 different pythons installed,Melodi,1,1,308
@Deleted User Look for some problems in your life that seem like they are interesting applications of Python as problem solving or automation tool,Ramon,,,
@killcams Almost certainly yes,Ramon,,,
okay so i have 3.8.2 and 3.5.0,Melodi,,,
which one do i uninstall,Melodi,,,
If one of them is tied to something important then it's unwise to just remove them,Ramon,,,
Which OS are you on?,Ramon,1,1,313
uhh wdym by OS,Melodi,1,1,316
sorry im stupid,Melodi,,,
operating sysem,Ramon,,,
Windows Linux Mac OS etc.,Ramon,,,
ph,Melodi,,,
oh,Melodi,,,
windows,Melodi,,,
OK,Ramon,,,
If you type `py` at the command line that will typically bring up the most recent version of Python,Ramon,,,
using cmd right,Melodi,,,
so you can use that to disambiguate which version you want to install in or use,Ramon,,,
Yes,Ramon,,,
3.8.2,Melodi,,,
eg. `py 3.8 m pip list` will bring up Python 3.8 and run `pip`,Ramon,,,
`py 3.8 myscript.py` will launch `myscript.py` using 3.8,Ramon,,,
How would you get people to use your creations? I feel like I'm programming for no reason since its not being used.,Claudette,1,1,329
@TricolorHen061 Post your work on GitHub or some other codesharing service. Get into a Discord or Reddit community that revolves around the thing you're trying to address,Ramon,,,
wait i think im using 3.5.0,Melodi,,,
None,Melodi,,,
that shows up,Melodi,,,
@killcams either way you can use `py` to bring up and work with a specific version,Ramon,,,
Use `py 0` to see which versions are installed,Ramon,,,
3.832,Melodi,,,
and,Melodi,,,
3.532,Melodi,,,
@Infinimata that sounds difficult? i will try,Khlifa,,,
@Deleted User Python's a tool it's used to make things easier. Look for something in your own life that's worth making easier or working on,Ramon,,,
Abstract problems aren't as compelling,Ramon,,,
should i uninstall both pythons and just reset everything,Melodi,1,1,342
@killcams As long as you are fairly confident you don't have anything that depends on one that'll be trashed,Ramon,,,
alright,Melodi,,,
okay,Khlifa,,,
Also you have the 32bit versions installed; you might want to install the 64bit versions,Ramon,,,
unless you're trying to keep compatibility with some 32bit library but that's exceedingly rare at this point,Ramon,,,
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python350/,Melodi,,,
which one,Melodi,1,1,349
Windows x8664 executable installer,Ramon,,,
that's generally the best bet,Ramon,,,
@Deleted User In my case I was having organizational problems with my creative projects so I've been making a personal wiki app,Ramon,,,
that's cool,Khlifa,,,

For anything where you are trying to extract information from a complexly formatted string or make changes to it you probably need to use `re` (regular expressions),Ramon,,,
