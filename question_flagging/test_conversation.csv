seems exactly what I want,Esme,,
for larger things I use a scratch file or pycharm's console with ipython,Karlei,,
was about to say pycharm has an ipython console,Noli,,
I use this normally because I don't want to launch pycharm,Esme,,
for stuff like showing a get request in a help channel,Esme,,
the repl treats repr(None) as `''` when returning it as an output,Princeton,,
sqlalchemy is pretty complex compared to other ORMs I used,Jessamine,,
guess it's because it's more than just an ORM,Jessamine,,
idk its not that terribly complicated although i dont know what you have used in the past,Jofre,,
Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.,Yusra,,
the normal repr of None is `'None'`,Princeton,,
"```pyIn [4]: type('',(),{'__repr__':lambda _: TTTT'})()Out[4]: TTTTIn [5]: repr(None)Out[5]: None'In [6]: None```",Princeton,,
Isn't declaring a function inside a function the same as playing with classes,Reylan,1,1
?,Reylan,,
(re the previous discussion),Reylan,,
why would it be?,Princeton,1,0
"```pythondef foo(): print(""a"") def bar(): print(""b"") bar()```is the same as```pythonclass foo(): def __init(self): print(""a"") self.bar() def bar(self): print(""b"")```No?",Reylan,,
I mean essentially the same,Reylan,,
no they are entirely different ideas working with classes and functions,Jofre,,
Oh lovely to know,Reylan,,
Thank you,Reylan,,
ye not quite related. foo.bar would not work in the first case,Princeton,,
if you have any questions about how classes or anything works you can feel free to ask here tho,Jofre,,
Then I don't fully understand the concept of functions within functions then,Reylan,,
What was meant by that,Reylan,1,0
def just does ```pyname = the function```,Princeton,,
i think what you are reaching at is the notion of namespace,Maicee,,
Just calling a function within another?,Reylan,1,1
classes and functions are both namespaces but they don't work exactly the same.,Maicee,,
with nested functions you have no control of instance data nor name inner functions (methods) and less control of scope,Ovidi,,
Ye,Reylan,,
Nested functions definitely have their uses,Noli,,
(closures are super handy for example),Noli,,
a class is more like a dictionary except a dictionary where the values can be functions which handily in Python is trivial,Ovidi,,
I wouldn't describe it that way,Noli,,
it's true that _most_ classes are dictionarybacked though,Noli,,
I say most because we also have `__slots__`,Noli,,
yes I'm describing just the structure not the typing aspect,Ovidi,,
or hierarchy of namespaces,Ovidi,,
@lakmatiol thanks dude I tried the graphical calculator and I made it my first project 😭,Valentine,,
Hello is it possible to draw a triangle (stroke without fill) into a png image when I know pixel positions of the triangle's 3 points? I'm using ``PIL`` library btw,Camden,1,0
^well I have UVs but the pixel coordinations can be calculated when I multiply them with image's size,Camden,,
HUH I must solve one thing with Py2...,Jamiel,,
Odoo 9...,Jamiel,,
I have to do one import/export module. This is really simple in Py3 but in Py2... it's sooo hard.,Jamiel,,
Rogue Lineage,Ioanna,,
need help with simple graphical calculator,Valentine,,
Is there a way to rename a file if you have the os.DirEntry of the file?,Ander,1,0
god,Jessamine,,
do I even need sqlalchemy,Jessamine,1,1
it's errors up the ass,Jessamine,,
For simple things I definitely prefer just writing SQL manually,Esme,,
but there are alternative ORMs,Esme,,
like Peewee I think is one,Esme,,
yaa I should just start out with a normal sql connector,Jessamine,,
worked fine on node,Jessamine,,
can i edit library ?,Giovana,1,1
What library,Yadiel,1,0
nothing,Giovana,,
Bruh Py2 is impossible,Jamiel,,
None,Ander,,
this is self torture,Ander,,
You probaby want to look into regular expressions,Abdesamad,,
yes i know,Ander,,
that's why i said self torture,Ander,,
:pithink:,Abdesamad,,
"If anyone ever neads to clean up youtube api\'s search results in songs here is the monstrosity i used:```pysong.name.lower().replace( .mp3 ).replace(""[audio] ).replace( (lyric video) ).replace( official ).replace(""video ).replace( ep ).replace(""lyrics ).replace( ( ).replace("") ).replace( [ ).replace(""] ).replace( audio ).replace( lyric ).replace( audio ).replace( official ).replace( album ).replace( version ).replace( ft. ).replace( _ waterparks _ ).replace( from suicide squad ).replace( 360 ).replace( virtualizer™ ).replace( music )```",Ander,,
It also follows pep8,Ander,,
(technically),Ander,,
You could put all the terms in a list,Abdesamad,,
and do ```pyfor term in terms: string = string.replace(term )```,Abdesamad,,
or you could look into regex,Abdesamad,,
though it probably isn't the best option either,Abdesamad,,
Idk,Ander,,
This frightens me,Jaimar,,
I will probably share the whole code later,Ander,,
I'd go with the list option here tbh.,Jaimar,,
regex will still look like a monster but I think it'll be faster,Jessamine,,
import regex would probably make the time around the same,Ander,,
just a doubt u k for if statemetns and such,Melrose,,
so u can have only one If and as many elif as u want and only one else?,Melrose,1,1
you could also use sth like SLY to write a grammar and only take the name you want,Princeton,,
sorry wrong cahnnel my bad,Mackinley,,
@Sir JCB yes,Abdesamad,,
Though it's important to know the difference between ```pyif a: ...if b: ...```and ```pyif a: ...elif b: ...```In the former both `if` statements get executed. In the latter `elif b` only gets executed if `if a` fails first,Abdesamad,,
yeah ik what the differenences are but i just had a oubt where can u use elif muliple times,Melrose,,
but thanks :),Melrose,,
wait u can use if statements multiple times too?,Melrose,1,1
yes you can use elif mltiple times,Mackinley,,
every `if` statements starts a new chain,Abdesamad,,
gotchu,Melrose,,
wtf,Keirah,,
dumb yanderedev memes,Abdesamad,,
Welcome to the python zone,Ioanna,,
😳,Ioanna,,
Someone give me image,Ander,,
url to any image,Ander,,
I need to test something,Ander,,
https://discordapp.com/assets/9be66884222f362fd161718c45fd9663.svg,Esme,,
That's svg,Ander,,
this isn't the right channel though,Esme,,
svg is an image format,Esme,,
go to google images or imgur not an ontopic channel,Esme,,
It is related to python,Ander,,
look no one is going to post random images in here with 4 admins + 4 moderators looking on just for you ...,Ovidi,,
Ok,Ander,,
look at pins,Princeton,,
there is one image and one video there,Princeton,,
Ok,Ander,,
Now back on topic,Ander,,
Let's say I have a condition in the program to check if string doesn't include anything other than letters and want to successfully exit out if it's not. What I can use:```if False == s.isalpha(): exit() or return or what```,Keyvan,1,1
well exit will exit out of the program and return will stop the function another thing is you can do in this case to check if something is false by doing `if not s.isalpha()`,Jofre,,
exit will be considered an error I thought,Keyvan,,
what will be a Pythonic practice to stop the execution of the program gracefully,Keyvan,1,1
I mean it is not an error that someone put a digit in a string. I just dont want to run the program if he did,Keyvan,,
if you want to exit the program you can use exit() or sys.exit(),Jofre,,
sys.exit() allows you to pass a exit code as well \\,Jofre,,
sys.exit() throws the exception too,Keyvan,,
I dont want to,Keyvan,,
you exiting the program why does it matter if a exception is thrown,Jofre,1,0
or I should throw an exception telling the that user didn't enter correct input,Keyvan,1,0
this looks good idea then,Keyvan,,
how graceful do you mean? ``raise SystemExit('Only letters')``,Ovidi,1,0
also sys.exit runs in the background its not gonna show anythign im pretty sure,Jofre,,
```Create a Python databaseaccess API for accessing Question and Choice objects.``` what does this line mean? what does databaseaccess api mean?,Christophe,1,1
sounds to me like it might mean an ORM type thing,Esme,,
or you can do what squeeze said even though thats all sys.exit is doing in the background aswell,Jofre,,
whereby you can edit/create data within the database using python classess instead of via SQL,Esme,,
but I'm not at all sure,Esme,,
might mean a Rest API,Esme,,
YES I DID IT,Ander,,
is map is a pure function?,Natnael,1,0
what's an api 😅 ?,Christophe,,
sorry i am a newbie,Christophe,,
application program interface,Esme,,
application programming interface,Jofre,,
what does it mean,Christophe,1,1
Its a programmatic way to interact with a system,Esme,,
(ak907 was right its programming not program),Esme,,
so it creates for python a way to interact with the database instead of using sql?,Christophe,1,1
Kinda,Esme,,
@battlefist can you define `pure function` im not quite sure what that intails,Jofre,,
so i can delete create tables etc with python instead of sql,Christophe,,
What would happen is you'd write some code using SQL that lets future people interact with the database without SQL,Esme,,
But I might be wrong in my interpretation,Esme,,
do you have more info about what you're doing?,Esme,1,1
yeah one sec,Christophe,,
None,Christophe,,
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/,Christophe,,
"@squeeze ```raise SystemExit(\'Only Letters Please :)\')``` throws this: ```An exception has occurred use %tb to see the full traceback.SystemExit: Only Letters Please :)/usr/lib/python3.8/sitepackages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:3339: UserWarning: To exit: use \'exit\ \'quit\ or CtrlD. warn(""To exit: use \'exit\ \'quit\ or CtrlD. stacklevel=1)```",Keyvan,,
you may be right it helps me use python to access the models rather than sql,Christophe,,
I dont want to see the path to ipython,Keyvan,,
Ah  OK I understand fully now,Esme,,
Have you worked through that tutorial yet?,Esme,1,1
@battlefist it should be. it has no side effects doesn't alter the original argument you gave it and it doesn't change the results for the same arguments you give it.,Cannen,,
its from the Django tutorial right?,Esme,1,1
not yet i'm still at that point,Christophe,,
yeah,Christophe,,
@squeeze @INuke I just want it to say the message,Keyvan,,
or are you just trying to understand Django?,Esme,1,1
yeah ^,Christophe,,
and trying to create my first project with it,Christophe,,
thanks @Scragly,Natnael,,
Ok so what Django does for database access is use something called an ORM (Object Relational ~~Model~~ Mapping). That lets you define create and modify python objects instead of writing SQL  thats all done for you. So instead of creating a `question` table in your DB you'd create a `Question` model in your Django code run something called a migration and then interact with the database via that model,Esme,,
I'm wrong about ORMs meaning,Esme,,
its actually Object Relational Mapping,Esme,1,0
@INuke if I use exit() then last line of the program still runs . where should I paste the code?,Keyvan,,
Unless you're stuck with the tutorial I'd reccomend just starting. I might be confusing you more than helping you,Esme,,
its not too complicated once you get started,Esme,,
no i get it,Christophe,,
but that ORM is new to me my programming background is basic,Christophe,,
i only know python and i am intermediate with it,Christophe,,
i did not learn anything else,Christophe,,
but thanks i get what it does now,Christophe,,
if you want to think about it very simply its something that lets you map python objects to sql without you writing sql (this is very much dumbed down in this explanation),Jofre,,
I get it thanks guys ❤️,Christophe,,
@Arnuld im still not sure about your question you put `exit()` where ever you want your program to exit or quit out,Jofre,,
@INuke if I use exit() it exit the ipython interpreter,Keyvan,,
What is the code you're trying to run,Esme,,
can you just paste it here and explain what its not doing that you expect it to do?,Esme,1,0
yeah lets get back to the base question i dont think i understand what your asking,Jofre,,
@Charlie code is 18 lines long,Keyvan,,
!paste,Esme,,
None,Yusra,,
https://paste.pythondiscord.com/epubuzudih.py,Keyvan,,
replace your exit() with `return`,Esme,,
also btw on line 3 you can use `if not s.isalpha()` to make it a little less redundent,Jofre,,
ok,Keyvan,,
understood,Keyvan,,
C language habits 😛,Keyvan,,
all `not` does is basically takes whatever the output of the expression is and returns the oppisite bool so somethign that would be True would turn into False ect,Jofre,,
Your while loop also could/should be replaced with a `for i in range()` loop,Esme,,
`for j in range(i+1 len(s))`,Esme,,
oh good technique,Keyvan,,
yep where range takes args like this `start end step` where step is what to count by,Jofre,,
I am looking for an text/code editor where copypastingrunning code is seamless between 3 things: the editor ipython and web pastes (Emacs is bit tricky in doing that),Keyvan,,
with C/C++ Emacs was fine with python I am getting bit irritated,Keyvan,,
yeah i have no clue about emacs but if your looking for another editor i can only suggest sublime atom or vscode and if you want a full ide pycharm is it,Jofre,,
I also believe you can set up emacs to be smooth with pycharm  although I personally have no idea how,Esme,,
ok let me get with Atom and VScode,Keyvan,,
